# Overconfidence Password Generator

This add-on will create random, strong passwords locally using English and non-keyboard characters. They will be extremely hard to crack and impossible to guess. Generated passwords will not be stored in anywhere. Therefore, you'll have to use a password manager to store these passwords. Otherwise, you'll not be able to remember generated passwords.

### It seems like an overkill?
Yes. It is. But then again, you're using a password manager. So, why not. (As long as these passwords are supported)
On the other hand, sometimes cracking passwords can be easier than you think.

### How difficult is it to crack a password anyway?
